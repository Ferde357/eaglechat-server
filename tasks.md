Code Organization
Create a plan to better organize the code. The plan needs to be approved before code changes are made. Existing endpoints for the api should not be broken by the changes.

AI Service
- Put in own folder and break out based on AI model. We can further break out code into functionaly named files. For example, validations, conversation, etc. Use names
that make sense to a user. This will allow us to have additional files when we add more functionalty like vector operations and RAG.

Database
- Organize the database functions and add a readme

Other
- Organize into folders where it makes sense. Update file names when appropriate. It is OK to not organize a file into folder where it's logical to do that.
